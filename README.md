## This is a solution for NGP Van Coding Problem.

Please, add your credentials in 'add_credentials.json', and change the file name to 'credentials.json'.

To run the solution code, please, use `node ngpvan.js ` in terminal (assuming you have node.js installed globally) 

Email report complete, file is EmailReport.csv
 `cat EmailReport.csv` will show the result

please, note that I couldn't meet the last requirement (Finally, you should include the name of the variant associated with that email that has the highest percentage-based performance on Opens.) 
 Variant object returned from API appears to be changed and contains no information on variant percentage-based performance on Opens. It has suspitious  "emailMessageId": 0 and variant ID, but no performance data.
